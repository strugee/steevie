# LFAQ (less frequently asked questions)

Q: Is this file the same as /etc/README on steevie?

A: No.

Q: Why?

A: Because reasons. That file is slowly being merged into this repo. E.g. the TODO section has been moved here.

Q: Speaking of which, why is there a TODO.md file instead of GitHub Issues?

A: The entire point of steevie is to escape centralization and closed-source network services. It would be highly ironic if I put TODOs for steevie into a closed-source, centralized product which is not (to my knowledge) easy to get data off of.

Q: Then why is this on GitHub at all?

A: Because there is no danger, and it's convenient. Git's design ensures that cryptographically, GitHub can't screw with data without someone noticing. And Git's distributed nature ensures that even if GitHub chooses to (or is forced to) censor part of this repo, I can easily move somewhere else.
